<!--
    Using JavaScript, jQuery, and the Fetch API accessing jsonplaceholder,
    create a simple website that will
    1. create a selection list of the users found in the user resource. The 
       initial value of the selection list is to be the first user delivered 
       from the users resource.
    2. display the names of the albums that the currently selected user has. 
       Maybe an unordered list might work well.
    3. whenever a different user is selected, a new album list should appear.
